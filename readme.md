##  ‚≠ê Direct Script Execution

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sergisvk/exaroton-reset.git
    cd exaroton-reset
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    TOKEN=
    TIMEZONE=Europe/Madrid
    WEBHOOK_URL=
    CRON_SCHEDULE="0 6 * * *"
    ID_SERVER=""
    LANGUAGE="es-ES"
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## üêã Docker Execution

### Option 1: Docker Execution

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sergisvk/exaroton-reset.git
    cd exaroton-reset
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    TOKEN=
    TIMEZONE=Europe/Madrid
    WEBHOOK_URL=
    CRON_SCHEDULE="0 6 * * *"
    ID_SERVER=""
    LANGUAGE="es-ES"
    ```

3. Build the Docker image and run the container:
    ```sh
    docker build -t exaroton-reset .
    docker run --env-file .env exaroton-reset
    ```
   
### Option 2: Docker Compose Execution

The project is configured to deploy automatically using GitHub Actions. 
Whenever a new version is released or a push is made to the `master` branch, 
a new Docker image will be built and published to the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      exaroton-reset:
        image: ghcr.io/sergisvk/exaroton-reset:latest
        environment:
          - TOKEN=${TOKEN}
          - TIMEZONE=${TIMEZONE}
          - WEBHOOK_URL=${WEBHOOK_URL}
          - ID_SERVER=${ID_SERVER}
          - CRON_SCHEDULE=${CRON_SCHEDULE}
          - LANGUAGE=${LANGUAGE}
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

2. Run the following command to start the container:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

This will start the container using the latest image published in the GitHub Container Registry and the environment variables defined in the `.env` file.
